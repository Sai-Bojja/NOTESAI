        * Introduce basic "workspaces" or shared note collections.
    2.  **Note Organization:**
        * Implement basic tagging for notes.
        * Allow users to categorize notes.
    3.  **Improved UI/UX:**
        * Enhanced UI for better navigation and note management (using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).
    4.  **Metadata Handling:**
        * Allow users to add and view basic metadata (author, creation date).
    5.  **Scalability Testing and Vector Database Evaluation:**
        * Basic load testing.
        * Evaluation of Pinecone or Weaviate.
    6.  **Refined Answer Generation:**
        * Experiment with LLM prompts and parameters.
        * Explore adding citations.
* **Deliverables:**
    * User authentication and basic workspace functionality.
    * Note tagging and categorization.
    * Improved user interface.
    * Ability to manage basic note metadata.
    * Preliminary scalability assessment.
    * Potentially improved answer quality with citations.

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities and Platform Enhancements

* **Goal:** Add more sophisticated features and prepare the platform for wider adoption.
* **Timeline (Estimated):** 8-12 weeks
* **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
        * Implement granular permissions within workspaces.
    2.  **Data Connectors (Initial):**
        * Integration with one external data source (e.g., file upload for PDFs/text).
    3.  **Advanced Search:**
        * Filtering by tags, categories, and metadata.
    4.  **User Feedback System:**
        * Mechanism for users to rate and provide feedback on answers.
    5.  **Monitoring and Logging (Enhanced):**
        * Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus).
        * More detailed logging.
    6.  **Security Enhancements:**
        * Basic data encryption at rest.
        * Initial security review.
* **Deliverables:**
    * Role-based access control within workspaces.
    * Ability to import data from at least one external source.
    * Advanced search and filtering capabilities.
